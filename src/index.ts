***              Hunt the Snark!              ***
*************************************************
 The SNARK is a vicious beast that lives in the
 dismal swamp outside the city. To hunt it, you
 must enter 2 coordinates, each from 0-9 using
 an x y format (x = South/North, y = West/East).
 You will then be told how accurate your aim is.
 You have just 5 shots to find the SNARK!
