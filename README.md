# The Snark

The Snark is based on a tutorial that many of us at Monash University completed during the amazing FIT1002 - Programming 101.

This is my attempt at recreating the assignment in Typescript - 9 years later!

Its essentially a mini version of Battleship but instead of ships its rocks and a hidden monster!

The purpose of this assignment for myself is to learn Typescript and see how far I have come since my University Days.

> Does this mean there will be tests?

YES!
