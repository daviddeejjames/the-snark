# The Snark

The Snark is based on a tutorial that many of us at Monash University completed during the amazing FIT1002 - Programming 101.

This is my attempt at recrating the assignment in Typescript - x years later!

Its essentially a mini version of Battleship but instead of ships its rocks and a hidden monster!
